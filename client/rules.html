        <p align="left">It's all anonymous but you need to setup an account (no email needed).
            You compete against another player. Both players bet the same small amount in BTC.
            The winner gets both amounts.</p>
        <p>The process is fully automated. You bet, someone else bets, both play and winner gets both bets.</p>
        <p>Before being in a game you need to enter your bitcoin address to get any proceeds.
                We only send to this address and never deduct. Enter it in Rules/Settings</p>
        <p>You then create a new game or join an existing game.</p>
        <p>Game is to drop a square as close to the target line without hitting it. If it hits then
                score is zero and you loose or tie.</p>
        <p>It's not allowed to refresh the page after hitting the Start button. If you do, it will
                result in a zero score.</p>
        <p>Practice the game before you play for real.</p>
        <p>After joining or starting a game you have 24 hours to deposit the bitcoins. After 24 hours with no
            deposit your participation in the game will be canceled.</p>
